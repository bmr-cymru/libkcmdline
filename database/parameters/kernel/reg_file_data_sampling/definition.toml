description = '''[X86] Controls mitigation for Register File Data
Sampling (RFDS) vulnerability. RFDS is a CPU
vulnerability which may allow userspace to infer
kernel data values previously stored in floating point
registers, vector registers, or integer registers.
RFDS only affects Intel Atom processors.

on:	Turns ON the mitigation.
off:	Turns OFF the mitigation.

This parameter overrides the compile time default set
by CONFIG_MITIGATION_RFDS. Mitigation cannot be
disabled when other VERW based mitigations (like MDS)
are enabled. In order to disable RFDS mitigation all
VERW based mitigations need to be disabled.
