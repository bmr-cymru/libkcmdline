description = '''Disable merging of slabs with similar size. May be
necessary if there is some reason to distinguish
environments where the risk of heap overflows and
layout control by attackers can usually be
frustrated by disabling merging. This will reduce
most of the exposure of a heap attack to a single
cache (risks via metadata attacks are mostly
unchanged). Debug options disable merging on their
own.
For more information see
Documentation/admin-guide/mm/slab.rst.
