<string>
as the stability checks done at bootup.	Used to enable
virtualized environment.
[x86] noirqtime: Do not use TSC to do irq accounting.
Used to run time disable IRQ_TIME_ACCOUNTING on any
platforms where RDTSC is slow and this accounting
can add overhead.
marks the TSC unconditionally unstable at bootup and
avoids any further wobbles once the TSC watchdog notices.
[x86] nowatchdog: disable clocksource watchdog. Used
in situations with strict latency requirements (where
interruptions from clocksource watchdog are not
acceptable).
[x86] recalibrate: force recalibration against a HW timer
(HPET or PM timer) on systems whose TSC frequency was
obtained from HW or FW using either an MSR or CPUID(0x15).
Warn if the difference is more than 500 ppm.
[x86] watchdog: Use TSC as the watchdog clocksource with
only on systems where TSC has been deemed trustworthy.
This will be suppressed by an earlier tsc=nowatchdog and
can be overridden by a later tsc=nowatchdog.  A console
message will flag any such suppression or overriding.
