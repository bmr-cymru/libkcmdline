description = '''[KNL] Should the hung task detector generate panics.

A value of 1 instructs the kernel to panic when a
hung task is detected. The default value is controlled
by the CONFIG_BOOTPARAM_HUNG_TASK_PANIC build-time
option. The value selected by this boot parameter can
be changed later by the kernel.hung_task_panic sysctl.
