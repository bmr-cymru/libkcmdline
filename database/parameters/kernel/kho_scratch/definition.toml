description = '''Defines the size of the KHO scratch region. The KHO
scratch regions are physically contiguous memory
ranges that can only be used for non-kernel
allocations. That way, even when memory is heavily
fragmented with handed over memory, the kexeced
kernel will always have enough contiguous ranges to
bootstrap itself.

It is possible to specify the exact amount of
memory in the form of "ll[KMG],mm[KMG],nn[KMG]"
where the first parameter defines the size of a low
memory scratch area, the second parameter defines
the size of a global scratch area and the third
parameter defines the size of additional per-node
scratch areas.  The form "nn%" defines scale factor
(in percents) of memory that was used during boot.
