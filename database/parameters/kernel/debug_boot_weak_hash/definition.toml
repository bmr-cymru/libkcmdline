description = '''[KNL,EARLY] Enable printing [hashed] pointers early in the
boot sequence.  If enabled, we use a weak hash instead
of siphash to hash pointers.  Use this option if you are
seeing instances of '(___ptrval___)') and need to see a
value (hashed pointer) instead. Cryptographically
insecure, please do not use on production kernels.
