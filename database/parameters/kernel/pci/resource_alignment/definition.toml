Specifies alignment and device to reassign
aligned memory resources. How to
specify the device is described above.
If <order of align> is not specified,
PAGE_SIZE is used as alignment.
A PCI-PCI bridge can be specified if resource
windows need to be expanded.
To specify the alignment for several
instances of a device, the PCI vendor,
device, subvendor, and subdevice may be
specified, e.g., 12@pci:8086:9c22:103c:198f
for 4096-byte alignment.'''
