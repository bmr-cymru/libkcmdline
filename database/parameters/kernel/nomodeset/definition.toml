description = '''kernel modesetting. Most systems' firmware
sets up a display mode and provides framebuffer memory
for output. With nomodeset, DRM and fbdev drivers will
not load if they could possibly displace the pre-
initialized output. Only the system framebuffer will
be available for use. The respective drivers will not
perform display-mode changes or accelerated rendering.

Useful as error fallback, or for testing and debugging.
