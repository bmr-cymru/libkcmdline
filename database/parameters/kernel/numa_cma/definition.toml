Sets the size of kernel numa memory area for
contiguous memory allocations. It will reserve CMA
area for the specified node.

With numa CMA enabled, DMA users on node nid will
first try to allocate buffer from the numa area
which is located in node nid, if the allocation fails,
they will fallback to the global default memory area.
