option prevents Linux from overwriting the CMCI
threshold set by the bios.  Without this option, Linux
always sets the CMCI threshold to 1. Enabling this may
make memory predictive failure analysis less effective
if the bios sets thresholds for memory errors since we
will not see details for all errors.
