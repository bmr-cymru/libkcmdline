description = '''Set initial timeout in jiffies for RCU task stall
informational messages, which give some indication
of the problem for those not patient enough to
wait for ten minutes.  Informational messages are
only printed prior to the stall-warning message
for a given grace period. Disable with a value
less than or equal to zero.  Defaults to ten
seconds.  A change in value does not take effect
until the beginning of the next grace period.
