description = '''disable CMCI(Corrected Machine Check Interrupt) that
Intel processor supports.  Usually this disablement is
not recommended, but it might be handy if your
hardware is misbehaving.

Note that you'll get more problems without CMCI than
with due to the shared banks, i.e. you might get
duplicated error logs.
