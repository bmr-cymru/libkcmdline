description = '''Sleep options
See Documentation/power/video.rst for information on
s3_bios and s3_mode.
s3_beep is for debugging; it makes the PC's speaker beep
as soon as the kernel's real-mode entry point is called.
s4_hwsig causes the kernel to check the ACPI hardware
signature during resume from hibernation, and gracefully
refuse to resume if it has changed. This complies with
the ACPI specification but not with reality, since
Windows does not do this and many laptops do change it
on docking. So the default behaviour is to allow resume
and simply warn when the signature changes, unless the
s4_hwsig option is enabled.
s4_nohwsig prevents ACPI hardware signature from being
used (or even warned about) during resume.
old_ordering causes the ACPI 1.0 ordering of the _PTS
control method, with respect to putting devices into
low power states, to be enforced (the ACPI 2.0 ordering
of _PTS is used by default).
nonvs prevents the kernel from saving/restoring the
ACPI NVS memory during suspend/hibernation and resume.
sci_force_enable causes the kernel to set SCI_EN directly
on resume from S1/S3 (which is against the ACPI spec,
but some broken systems don't work without it).
nobl causes the internal blacklist of systems known to
behave incorrectly in some ways with respect to system
suspend and resume to be ignored (use wisely).
