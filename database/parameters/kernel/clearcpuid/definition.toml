description = '''Disable CPUID feature X for the kernel. See
arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h for the valid bit
numbers X. Note the Linux-specific bits are not necessarily
stable over kernel options, but the vendor-specific
ones should be.
X can also be a string as appearing in the flags: line
in /proc/cpuinfo which does not have the above
instability issue. However, not all features have names
in /proc/cpuinfo.
Note that using this option will taint your kernel.
Also note that user programs calling CPUID directly
or using the feature without checking anything
will still see it. This just prevents it from
being used by the kernel or shown in /proc/cpuinfo.
Also note the kernel might malfunction if you disable
some critical bits.
