title = "ttyUSB0[,options] - definition.toml"
name = "ttyUSB0[,options]"
processor = "kernel"
description = '''Use the specified serial port.  The options are of
the form "bbbbpnf", where "bbbb" is the baud rate,
"p" is parity ("n", "o", or "e"), "n" is number of
bits, and "f" is flow control ("r" for RTS or
omit it).  Default is "9600n8".

See Documentation/admin-guide/serial-console.rst for more
information.  See
Documentation/networking/netconsole.rst for an
alternative.

Use the specified serial port on the serial core bus.
The addressing uses DEVNAME of the physical serial port
device, followed by the serial core controller instance,
and the serial port instance. The options are the same
as documented for the ttyS addressing above.

The mapping of the serial ports to the tty instances
can be viewed with:

$ ls -d /sys/bus/serial-base/devices/*:*.*/tty/*
/sys/bus/serial-base/devices/00:04:0.0/tty/ttyS0

In the above example, the console can be addressed with
console=00:04:0.0. Note that a console addressed this
way will only get added when the related device driver
is ready. The use of an earlycon parameter in addition to
the console may be desired for console output early on.
