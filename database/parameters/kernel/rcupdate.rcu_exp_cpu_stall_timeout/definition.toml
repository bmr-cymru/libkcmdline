messages.  The value is in milliseconds
and the maximum allowed value is 21000
milliseconds. Please note that this value is
adjusted to an arch timer tick resolution.
Setting this to zero causes the value from
rcupdate.rcu_cpu_stall_timeout to be used (after
conversion from seconds to milliseconds).
