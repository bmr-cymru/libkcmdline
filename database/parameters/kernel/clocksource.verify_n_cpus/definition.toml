description = '''Limit the number of CPUs checked for clocksources
marked with CLOCK_SOURCE_VERIFY_PERCPU that
are marked unstable due to excessive skew.
A negative value says to check all CPUs, while
zero says not to check any.  Values larger than
nr_cpu_ids are silently truncated to nr_cpu_ids.
The actual CPUs are chosen randomly, with
no replacement if the same CPU is chosen twice.
