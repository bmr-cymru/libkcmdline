description = '''This parameter sets the initial value of the
/sys/power/pm_async sysfs knob at boot time.
If set to "off", disables asynchronous suspend and
resume of devices during system-wide power transitions.
This can be useful on platforms where device
dependencies are not well-defined, or for debugging
power management issues. Asynchronous operations are
enabled by default.
