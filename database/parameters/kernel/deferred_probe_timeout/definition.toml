description = '''[KNL] Debugging option to set a timeout in seconds for
deferred probe to give up waiting on dependencies to
probe. Only specific dependencies (subsystems or
drivers) that have opted in will be ignored. A timeout
of 0 will timeout at the end of initcalls. If the time
out hasn't expired, it'll be restarted by each
successful driver registration. This option will also
dump out devices still on the deferred probe list after
retrying.
