they show better performance thanks to cache
be more power hungry than unbound workqueues.

Enabling this makes the per-cpu workqueues which
were observed to contribute significantly to power
power usage at the cost of small performance
overhead.

The default value of this parameter is determined by
the config option CONFIG_WQ_POWER_EFFICIENT_DEFAULT.

Select the default affinity scope to use for unbound
"numa" and "system". Default is "cache". For more

This can be changed after boot by writing to the
matching /sys/module/workqueue/parameters file. All
workqueues with the "default" affinity scope will be
updated accordingly.
