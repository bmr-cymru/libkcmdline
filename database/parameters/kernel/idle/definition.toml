description = '''idle=poll:  Don't do power saving in the idle loop
to get slightly better performance in multiprocessor
benchmarks. It also makes some profiling using
performance counters more accurate.  Please note that
on systems with MONITOR/MWAIT support (like Intel
EM64T CPUs) this option has no performance advantage
over the normal idle loop.  It may also interact badly
with hyperthreading.

idle=halt: Halt is forced to be used for CPU idle.
In such case C2/C3 won't be used again.

idle=nomwait: Disable mwait for CPU C-states
