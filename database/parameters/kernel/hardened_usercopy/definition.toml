hardening is enabled for this boot. Hardened
usercopy checking is used to protect the kernel
from reading or writing beyond known memory
allocation boundaries as a proactive defense
against bounds-checking flaws in the kernel's
copy_to_user()/copy_from_user() interface.
The default is determined by
CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY_DEFAULT_ON.'''
