description = '''Only jump to kdump kernel after running the panic
notifiers and dumping kmsg. This option increases
the risks of a kdump failure, since some panic
notifiers can make the crashed kernel more unstable.
In configurations where kdump may not be reliable,
running the panic notifiers could allow collecting
more data on dmesg, like stack traces from other CPUS
or extra data dumped by panic_print. Note that some
configurations enable this option unconditionally,
like Hyper-V, PowerPC (fadump) and AMD SEV-SNP.
