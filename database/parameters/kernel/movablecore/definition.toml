description = '''This parameter is the complement to kernelcore=, it
specifies the amount of memory used for migratable
allocations.  If both kernelcore and movablecore is
specified, then kernelcore will be at *least* the
specified value but may be more.  If movablecore on its
own is specified, the administrator must be careful
that the amount of memory usable for all allocations
is not too small.
