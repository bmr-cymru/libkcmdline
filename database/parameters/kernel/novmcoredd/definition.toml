description = '''Disable device dump. Device dump allows drivers to
append dump data to vmcore so you can collect driver
specified debug info.  Drivers can append the data
without any limit and this data is stored in memory,
so this may cause significant memory stress.  Disabling
device dump can help save memory but the driver debug
data will be no longer available.  This parameter
is only available when CONFIG_PROC_VMCORE_DEVICE_DUMP
is set.
