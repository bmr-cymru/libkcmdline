description = '''debug: enable misc debug output.
disable_early_pci_dma: disable the busmaster bit on all
PCI bridges while in the EFI boot stub.
nochunk: disable reading files in "chunks" in the EFI
boot stub, as chunking can cause problems with some
firmware implementations.
noruntime : disable EFI runtime services support
nosoftreserve: The EFI_MEMORY_SP (Specific Purpose)
attribute may cause the kernel to reserve the
memory range for a memory mapping driver to
claim. Specify efi=nosoftreserve to disable this
reservation and treat the memory by its base type
(i.e. EFI_CONVENTIONAL_MEMORY / "System RAM").
novamap: do not call SetVirtualAddressMap().
no_disable_early_pci_dma: Leave the busmaster bit set
on all PCI bridges while in the EFI boot stub
