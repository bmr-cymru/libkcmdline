description = '''Probe mask for legacy ISA PATA ports.  Depending on
platform configuration and the use of other driver
options up to 6 legacy ports are supported: 0x1f0,
0x170, 0x1e8, 0x168, 0x1e0, 0x160, however probing
of individual ports can be disabled by setting the
corresponding bits in the mask to 1.  Bit 0 is for
the first port in the list above (0x1f0), and so on.
By default all supported ports are probed.
