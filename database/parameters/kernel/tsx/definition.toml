Extensions (TSX) feature in Intel processors that
support TSX control.

This parameter controls the TSX feature. The options are:

TSX has been known to be an accelerator for
so there may be unknown	security risks associated
with leaving it enabled.

off	- Disable TSX on the system. (Note that this
option takes effect only on newer CPUs which are
MSR_IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES.MDS_NO=1 and which get
the new IA32_TSX_CTRL MSR through a microcode
update. This new MSR allows for the reliable
deactivation of the TSX functionality.)

otherwise enable TSX on the system.

Not specifying this option is equivalent to tsx=off.
