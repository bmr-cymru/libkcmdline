description = '''The argument is a cpu list, as described above.
In kernels built with CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL=y, set
the specified list of CPUs whose tick will be stopped
whenever possible. The boot CPU will be forced outside
the range to maintain the timekeeping.  Any CPUs
in this list will have their RCU callbacks offloaded,
just as if they had also been called out in the
rcu_nocbs= boot parameter.

Note that this argument takes precedence over
the CONFIG_RCU_NOCB_CPU_DEFAULT_ALL option.
