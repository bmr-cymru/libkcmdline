The "tcb" policy measures all programs exec'd, files
mmap'd for exec, and all files opened with the read
mode bit set by either the effective uid (euid=0) or
uid=0.

The "appraise_tcb" policy appraises the integrity of
all files owned by root.

The "secure_boot" policy appraises the integrity
of files (eg. kexec kernel image, kernel modules,
firmware, policy, etc) based on file signatures.

The "fail_securely" policy forces file signature
verification failure also on privileged mounted
filesystems with the SB_I_UNVERIFIABLE_SIGNATURE
flag.

The "critical_data" policy measures kernel integrity
critical data.
