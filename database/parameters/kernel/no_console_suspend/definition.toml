description = '''[HW] Never suspend the console
Disable suspending of consoles during suspend and
hibernate operations.  Once disabled, debugging
messages can reach various consoles while the rest
of the system is being put to sleep (ie, while
debugging driver suspend/resume hooks).  This may
not work reliably with all consoles, but is known
to work with serial and VGA consoles.
To facilitate more flexible debugging, we also add
console_suspend, a printk module parameter to control
it. Users could use console_suspend (usually
/sys/module/printk/parameters/console_suspend) to
turn on/off it dynamically.
