description = '''Set the hostname (aka UTS nodename).
This allows setting the system's hostname during early
startup. This sets the name returned by gethostname.
Using this parameter to set the hostname makes it
possible to ensure the hostname is correctly set before
any userspace processes run, avoiding the possibility
that a process may call gethostname before the hostname
has been explicitly set, resulting in the calling
process getting an incorrect result. The string must
not exceed the maximum allowed hostname length (usually
64 characters) and will be truncated otherwise.
