description = '''Set the SCHED_FIFO priority of the RCU per-CPU
kthreads (rcuc/N). This value is also used for
the priority of the RCU boost threads (rcub/N)
and for the RCU grace-period kthreads (rcu_bh,
rcu_preempt, and rcu_sched). If RCU_BOOST is
set, valid values are 1-99 and the default is 1
(the least-favored priority).  Otherwise, when
RCU_BOOST is not set, valid values are 0-99 and
the default is zero (non-realtime operation).
When RCU_NOCB_CPU is set, also adjust the
priority of NOCB callback kthreads.
