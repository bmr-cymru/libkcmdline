description = '''Create device links between consumer and supplier
devices by scanning the firmware to infer the
consumer/supplier relationships. This feature is
especially useful when drivers are loaded as modules as
it ensures proper ordering of tasks like device probing
(suppliers first, then consumers), supplier boot state
clean up (only after all consumers have probed),
suspend/resume & runtime PM (consumers first, then
suppliers).
off --	Don't create device links from firmware info.
permissive -- Create device links from firmware info
but use it only for ordering boot state clean
up (sync_state() calls).
on -- 	Create device links from firmware info and use it
to enforce probe and suspend/resume ordering.
rpm --	Like "on", but also use to order runtime PM.
