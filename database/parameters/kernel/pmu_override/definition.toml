description = '''Override the PMU.
This option takes over the PMU facility, so it is no
longer usable by perf. Setting this option starts the
PMU counters by setting MMCR0 to 0 (the FC bit is
cleared). If a number is given, then MMCR1 is set to
that number, otherwise (e.g., 'pmu_override=on'), MMCR1
remains 0.
