description = '''If the boot console provides the ability to read
characters and can work in polling mode, you can use
this parameter to tell kgdb to use it as a backend
until the normal console is registered. Intended to
be used together with the kgdboc parameter which
specifies the normal console to transition to.

The name of the early console should be specified
as the value of this parameter. Note that the name of
the early console might be different than the tty
name passed to kgdboc. It's OK to leave the value
blank and the first boot console that implements
read() will be picked.
