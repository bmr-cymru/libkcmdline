description = '''disable
Do not enable amd_pstate as the default
scaling driver for the supported processors
passive
Use amd_pstate with passive mode as a scaling driver.
In this mode autonomous selection is disabled.
Driver requests a desired performance level and platform
tries to match the same performance level if it is
satisfied by guaranteed performance level.
active
Use amd_pstate_epp driver instance as the scaling driver,
driver provides a hint to the hardware if software wants
to bias toward performance (0x0) or energy efficiency (0xff)
to the CPPC firmware. then CPPC power algorithm will
calculate the runtime workload and adjust the realtime cores
frequency.
guided
Activate guided autonomous mode. Driver requests minimum and
maximum performance level and the platform autonomously
selects a performance level in this range and appropriate
to the current workload.
