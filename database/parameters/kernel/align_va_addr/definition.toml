allocating a VMA at process creation time. This option
gives you up to 3% performance improvement on AMD F15h
machines (where it is enabled by default) for a
CPU-intensive style benchmark, and it can vary highly in
a microbenchmark depending on workload and compiler.

32: only for 32-bit processes
64: only for 64-bit processes
on: enable for both 32- and 64-bit processes
off: disable for both 32- and 64-bit processes
