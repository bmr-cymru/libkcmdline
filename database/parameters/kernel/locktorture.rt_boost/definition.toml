description = '''Do periodic testing of real-time lock priority
boosting.  Select 0 to disable, 1 to boost
only rt_mutex, and 2 to boost unconditionally.
Defaults to 2, which might seem to be an
odd choice, but which should be harmless for
non-real-time spinlocks, due to their disabling
of preemption.	Note that non-realtime mutexes
disable boosting.
