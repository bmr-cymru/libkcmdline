threshold are automatically considered CPU intensive
and excluded from concurrency management to prevent
them from noticeably delaying other per-cpu work
items. Default is 10000 (10ms).

will report the work functions which violate this
threshold repeatedly. They are likely good
candidates for using WQ_UNBOUND workqueues instead.
