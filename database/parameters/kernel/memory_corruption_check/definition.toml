description = '''Some BIOSes seem to corrupt the first 64k of
memory when doing things like suspend/resume.
Setting this option will scan the memory
looking for corruption.  Enabling this will
both detect corruption and prevent the kernel
from using the memory being corrupted.
However, its intended as a diagnostic tool; if
repeatable BIOS-originated corruption always
affects the same memory, you can use memmap=
to prevent the kernel from using that memory.
