description = '''This parameter enables what is exposed to
userspace and debugfs internal clients.
on: 	All functions are enabled.
no-mount:
Filesystem is not registered but kernel clients can
access APIs and a crashkernel can be used to read
its content. There is nothing to mount.
off: 	Filesystem is not registered and clients
get a -EPERM as result when trying to register files
or directories within debugfs.
This is equivalent of the runtime functionality if
debugfs was not enabled in the kernel at all.
Default value is set in build-time with a kernel configuration.
