description = '''Enforces page_ext initialization to earlier
stages so cover more early boot allocations.
Please note that as side effect some optimizations
might be disabled to achieve that (e.g. parallelized
memory initialization is disabled) so the boot process
might take longer, especially on systems with a lot of
memory. Available with CONFIG_PAGE_EXTENSION=y.
