description = '''[KNL,EARLY] Enable or disable kernel stack offset
randomization, which provides roughly 5 bits of
entropy, frustrating memory corruption attacks
that depend on stack address determinism or
cross-syscall address exposures. This is only
available on architectures that have defined
CONFIG_HAVE_ARCH_RANDOMIZE_KSTACK_OFFSET.
Default is CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_KSTACK_OFFSET_DEFAULT.
