description = '''Forces the kernel to
busy wait in do_idle() and not use the arch_cpu_idle()
implementation; requires CONFIG_GENERIC_IDLE_POLL_SETUP
to be effective. This is useful on platforms where the
sleep(SH) or wfi(ARM,ARM64) instructions do not work
correctly or when doing power measurements to evaluate
the impact of the sleep instructions. This is also
useful when using JTAG debugger.
