description = '''On callback-offloaded (rcu_nocbs) CPUs,
RCU reduces the lock contention that would
otherwise be caused by callback floods through
use of the ->nocb_bypass list.	However, in the
common non-flooded case, RCU queues directly to
the main ->cblist in order to avoid the extra
overhead of the ->nocb_bypass list and its lock.
But if there are too many callbacks queued during
a single jiffy, RCU pre-queues the callbacks into
the ->nocb_bypass queue.  The definition of "too
many" is supplied by this kernel boot parameter.
