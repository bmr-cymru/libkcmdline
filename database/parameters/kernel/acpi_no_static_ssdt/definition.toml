By default, SSDTs contained in the RSDT/XSDT will be
installed automatically and they will appear under
/sys/firmware/acpi/tables.
This option turns off this feature.
Note that specifying this option does not affect
dynamic table installation which will install SSDT
tables to /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/dynamic.
