description = '''Multiplier for time interval between successive
RCU task stall informational messages for a given
RCU tasks grace period.  This value is clamped
to one through ten, inclusive.	It defaults to
the value three, so that the first informational
message is printed 10 seconds into the grace
period, the second at 40 seconds, the third at
160 seconds, and then the stall warning at 600
seconds would prevent a fourth at 640 seconds.
