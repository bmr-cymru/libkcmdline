description = '''[KVM] Controls the time period at which KVM zaps 4KiB pages
back to huge pages. If the value is a non-zero N, KVM will
zap a portion (see ratio above) of the pages every N msecs.
If the value is 0 (the default), KVM will pick a period based
on the ratio, such that a page is zapped after 1 hour on average.
