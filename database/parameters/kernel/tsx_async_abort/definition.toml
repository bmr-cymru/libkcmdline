description = '''Control mitigation for the TSX Async
Abort (TAA) vulnerability.

Similar to Micro-architectural Data Sampling (MDS)
certain CPUs that support Transactional
Synchronization Extensions (TSX) are vulnerable to an
exploit against CPU internal buffers which can forward
information to a disclosure gadget under certain
conditions.

access data to which the attacker does not have direct
access.

This parameter controls the TAA mitigation.  The
options are:

full       - Enable TAA mitigation on vulnerable CPUs
if TSX is enabled.

is not disabled because CPU is not
vulnerable to cross-thread TAA attacks.
off        - Unconditionally disable TAA mitigation

prevented by an active MDS mitigation as both vulnerabilities
are mitigated with the same mechanism so in order to disable

Not specifying this option is equivalent to
tsx_async_abort=full.  On CPUs which are MDS affected
required and doesn't provide any additional
mitigation.
