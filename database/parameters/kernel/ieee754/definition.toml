description = '''Select IEEE Std 754 conformance mode
Default: strict

Choose which programs will be accepted for execution
based on the IEEE 754 NaN encoding(s) supported by
the FPU and the NaN encoding requested with the value
of an ELF file header flag individually set by each
binary.  Hardware implementations are permitted to
support either or both of the legacy and the 2008 NaN
encoding mode.

Available settings are as follows:
strict	accept binaries that request a NaN encoding
supported by the FPU
by the FPU
by the FPU
relaxed	accept any binaries regardless of whether
supported by the FPU
emulated accept any binaries but enable FPU emulator
if binary mode is unsupported by the FPU.

The FPU emulator is always able to support both NaN
'relaxed' straps the emulator for both legacy-NaN and
legacy processors and both NaN encodings on MIPS32 or
MIPS64 CPUs.

The setting for ABS.fmt/NEG.fmt instruction execution
except where unsupported by hardware.
