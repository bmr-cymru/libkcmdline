description = '''Sleep while stalling if set.  This will result
in warnings from preemptible RCU in addition to
any other stall-related activity.  Note that
in kernels built with CONFIG_PREEMPTION=n and
CONFIG_PREEMPT_COUNT=y, this parameter will
cause the CPU to pass through a quiescent state.
Given CONFIG_PREEMPTION=n, this will suppress
RCU CPU stall warnings, but will instead result
in scheduling-while-atomic splats.

Use of this module parameter results in splats.
