description = '''[X86,INTEL,EARLY] Control the Gather Data Sampling (GDS)
mitigation.

Gather Data Sampling is a hardware vulnerability which
allows unprivileged speculative access to data which was
previously stored in vector registers.

This issue is mitigated by default in updated microcode.
The mitigation may have a performance impact but can be
disabled. On systems without the microcode mitigation
disabling AVX serves as a mitigation.

force:	Disable AVX to mitigate systems without
microcode mitigation. No effect if the microcode
mitigation is present. Known to cause crashes in
userspace with buggy AVX enumeration.

off:	Disable GDS mitigation.
