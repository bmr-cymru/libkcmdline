given grace period before RCU starts
soliciting quiescent-state help from
rcu_note_context_switch() and cond_resched().
If not specified, the kernel will calculate
a value based on the most recent settings
of rcutree.jiffies_till_first_fqs
and rcutree.jiffies_till_next_fqs.
This calculated value may be viewed in
rcutree.jiffies_to_sched_qs.  Any attempt to set
rcutree.jiffies_to_sched_qs will be cheerfully
overwritten.
