description = '''SunRPC servers often require that client requests
originate from a privileged port (i.e. a port in the
range 0 < portnr < 1024).
An administrator who wishes to reserve some of these
ports for other uses may adjust the range that the
kernel's sunrpc client considers to be privileged
using these two parameters to set the minimum and
maximum port values.
