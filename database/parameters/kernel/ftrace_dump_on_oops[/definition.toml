[FTRACE] will dump the trace buffers on oops.
If no parameter is passed, ftrace will dump global
buffers of all CPUs, if you pass 2 or orig_cpu, it
will dump only the buffer of the CPU that triggered
the oops, or the specific instance will be dumped if
its name is passed. Multiple instance dump is also
supported, and instances are separated by commas. Each
instance supports only dump on CPU that triggered the
oops by passing 2 or orig_cpu to it.

ftrace_dump_on_oops=foo=orig_cpu

The above will dump only the buffer of "foo" instance
on CPU that triggered the oops.

ftrace_dump_on_oops,foo,bar=orig_cpu

The above will dump global buffer on all CPUs, the
buffer of "foo" instance on all CPUs and the buffer
of "bar" instance on CPU that triggered the oops.
