description = '''disable
Do not enable intel_pstate as the default
scaling driver for the supported processors
passive
Use intel_pstate as a scaling driver, but configure it
to work with generic cpufreq governors (instead of
enabling its internal governor).  This mode cannot be
used along with the hardware-managed P-states (HWP)
feature.
force
Enable intel_pstate on systems that prohibit it by default
in favor of acpi-cpufreq. Forcing the intel_pstate driver
instead of acpi-cpufreq may disable platform features, such
as thermal controls and power capping, that rely on ACPI
P-States information being indicated to OSPM and therefore
should be used with caution. This option does not work with
processors that aren't supported by the intel_pstate driver
or on platforms that use pcc-cpufreq instead of acpi-cpufreq.
no_hwp
Do not enable hardware P state control (HWP)
if available.
hwp_only
Only load intel_pstate on systems which support
hardware P state control (HWP) if available.
support_acpi_ppc
Enforce ACPI _PPC performance limits. If the Fixed ACPI
Description Table, specifies preferred power management
profile as "Enterprise Server" or "Performance Server",
then this feature is turned on by default.
per_cpu_perf_limits
Allow per-logical-CPU P-State performance control limits using
cpufreq sysfs interface
no_cas
Do not enable capacity-aware scheduling (CAS) on
hybrid systems
