description = '''If set to zero, move all RCU_SOFTIRQ processing to
per-CPU rcuc kthreads.  Defaults to a non-zero
value, meaning that RCU_SOFTIRQ is used by default.
Specify rcutree.use_softirq=0 to use rcuc kthreads.

But note that CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT=y kernels disable
this kernel boot parameter, forcibly setting it
to zero.
