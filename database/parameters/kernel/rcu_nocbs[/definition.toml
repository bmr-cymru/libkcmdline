description = '''[KNL] The optional argument is a cpu list,
as described above.

In kernels built with CONFIG_RCU_NOCB_CPU=y,
enable the no-callback CPU mode, which prevents
such CPUs' callbacks from being invoked in
softirq context.  Invocation of such CPUs' RCU
callbacks will instead be offloaded to "rcuox/N"
kthreads created for that purpose, where "x" is
"p" for RCU-preempt, "s" for RCU-sched, and "g"
for the kthreads that mediate grace periods; and
"N" is the CPU number. This reduces OS jitter on
the offloaded CPUs, which can be useful for HPC
and real-time workloads.  It can also improve
energy efficiency for asymmetric multiprocessors.

If a cpulist is passed as an argument, the specified
list of	CPUs is set to no-callback mode from boot.

Otherwise, if the '=' sign and the cpulist
arguments are omitted, no CPU will be set to
no-callback mode from boot but the mode may be
toggled at runtime via cpusets.

Note that this argument takes precedence over
the CONFIG_RCU_NOCB_CPU_DEFAULT_ALL option.
