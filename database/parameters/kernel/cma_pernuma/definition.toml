description = '''[KNL,CMA,EARLY]
Sets the size of kernel per-numa memory area for
contiguous memory allocations. A value of 0 disables
per-numa CMA altogether. And If this option is not
specified, the default value is 0.
With per-numa CMA enabled, DMA users on node nid will
first try to allocate buffer from the pernuma area
which is located in node nid, if the allocation fails,
they will fallback to the global default memory area.
