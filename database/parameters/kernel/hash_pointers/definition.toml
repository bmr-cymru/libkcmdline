description = '''[KNL,EARLY]
By default, when pointers are printed to the console
or buffers via the %p format string, that pointer is
"hashed", i.e. obscured by hashing the pointer value.
This is a security feature that hides actual kernel
addresses from unprivileged users, but it also makes
debugging the kernel more difficult since unequal
pointers can no longer be compared. The choices are:
Default: auto

auto   - Hash pointers unless slab_debug is enabled.
always - Always hash pointers (even if slab_debug is
enabled).
never  - Never hash pointers. This option should only
be specified when debugging the kernel. Do
not use on production kernels. The boot
param "no_hash_pointers" is an alias for
this mode.
