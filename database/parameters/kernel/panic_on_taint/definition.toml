description = '''Bitmask for conditionally calling panic() in add_taint()
Hexadecimal bitmask representing the set of TAINT flags
that will cause the kernel to panic when add_taint() is
called with any of the flags in this set.
The optional switch "nousertaint" can be utilized to
prevent userspace forced crashes by writing to sysctl
/proc/sys/kernel/tainted any flagset matching with the
bitmask set on panic_on_taint.
See Documentation/admin-guide/tainted-kernels.rst for
extra details on the taint flags that users can pick
to compose the bitmask to assign to panic_on_taint.
