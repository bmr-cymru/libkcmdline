description = '''Set the shift-right count to use to compute
the callback-invocation batch limit bl from
the number of callbacks queued on this CPU.
The result will be bounded below by the value of
the rcutree.blimit kernel parameter.  Every bl
callbacks, the softirq handler will exit in
order to allow the CPU to do other work.

Please note that this callback-invocation batch
limit applies only to non-offloaded callback
invocation.  Offloaded callbacks are instead
invoked in the context of an rcuoc kthread, which
scheduler will preempt as it does any other task.
