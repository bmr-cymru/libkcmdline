description = '''Control the ability to open a mounted block device
for writing, i.e., allow / disallow writes that bypass
the FS. This was implemented as a means to prevent
fuzzers from crashing the kernel by overwriting the
metadata underneath a mounted FS without its awareness.
This also prevents destructive formatting of mounted
filesystems by naive storage tooling that don't use
O_EXCL. Default is Y and can be changed through the
Kconfig option CONFIG_BLK_DEV_WRITE_MOUNTED.
