description = '''[FTRACE] On boot up, a snapshot will be taken of the
ftrace ring buffer that can be read at:
/sys/kernel/tracing/snapshot.
This is useful if you need tracing information from kernel
boot up that is likely to be overridden by user space
start up functionality.

Optionally, the snapshot can also be defined for a tracing
instance that was created by the trace_instance= command
line parameter.

trace_instance=foo,sched_switch ftrace_boot_snapshot=foo

The above will cause the "foo" tracing instance to trigger
a snapshot at the end of boot up.
