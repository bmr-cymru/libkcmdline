description = '''[KNL,EARLY] When CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC is set, this parameter
enables the feature at boot time. By default, it is
disabled and the system will work mostly the same as a
kernel built without CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC.
Note: to get most of debug_pagealloc error reports, it's
useful to also enable the page_owner functionality.
