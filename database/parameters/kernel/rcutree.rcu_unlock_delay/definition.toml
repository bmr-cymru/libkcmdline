description = '''In CONFIG_RCU_STRICT_GRACE_PERIOD=y kernels,
this specifies an rcu_read_unlock()-time delay
in microseconds.  This defaults to zero.
Larger delays increase the probability of
catching RCU pointer leaks, that is, buggy use
of RCU-protected pointers after the relevant
rcu_read_unlock() has completed.
