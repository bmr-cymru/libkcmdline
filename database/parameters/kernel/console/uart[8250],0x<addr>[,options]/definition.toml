description = '''Start an early, polled-mode console on the 8250/16550
UART at the specified I/O port or MMIO address,
switching to the matching ttyS device later.
MMIO inter-register address stride is either 8-bit
(mmio), 16-bit (mmio16), or 32-bit (mmio32).
If none of [io|mmio|mmio16|mmio32], <addr> is assumed
to be equivalent to 'mmio'. 'options' are specified in
the same format described for ttyS above; if unspecified,
the h/w is not re-initialized.
