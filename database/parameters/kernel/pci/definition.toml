description = '''various PCI subsystem options.

Some options herein operate on a specific device
or a set of devices (<pci_dev>). These are
specified in one of the following formats:

[<domain>:]<bus>:<dev>.<func>[/<dev>.<func>]*
pci:<vendor>:<device>[:<subvendor>:<subdevice>]

Note: the first format specifies a PCI
bus/device/function address which may change
if new hardware is inserted, if motherboard
firmware changes, or due to changes caused
by other kernel parameters. If the
domain is left unspecified, it is
taken to be zero. Optionally, a path
to a device through multiple device/function
addresses can be specified after the base
address (this is more robust against
renumbering issues).  The second format
selects devices using IDs from the
configuration space which may match multiple
devices in the system.
