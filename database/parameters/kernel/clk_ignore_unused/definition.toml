description = '''[CLK]
Prevents the clock framework from automatically gating
clocks that have not been explicitly enabled by a Linux
device driver but are enabled in hardware at reset or
by the bootloader/firmware. Note that this does not
force such clocks to be always-on nor does it reserve
those clocks in any way. This parameter is useful for
debug and development, but should not be needed on a
platform with proper driver support.  For more
information, see Documentation/driver-api/clk.rst.
