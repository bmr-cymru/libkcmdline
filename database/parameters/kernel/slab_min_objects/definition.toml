name = "slab_min_objects"
processor = "kernel"
description = '''The minimum number of objects per slab. SLUB will
increase the slab order up to slab_max_order to
generate a sufficiently large slab able to contain
the number of objects indicated. The higher the number
of objects the smaller the overhead of tracking slabs
and the less frequently locks need to be acquired.
For more information see
Documentation/admin-guide/mm/slab.rst.
