description = '''default: lazy
By default, unaccepted memory is accepted lazily to
avoid prolonged boot times. The lazy option will add
some runtime overhead until all memory is eventually
accepted. In most cases the overhead is negligible.
For some workloads or for debugging purposes
accept_memory=eager can be used to accept all memory
at once during boot.
