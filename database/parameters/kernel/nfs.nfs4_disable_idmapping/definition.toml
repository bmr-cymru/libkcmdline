description = '''[NFSv4] When set to the default of '1', this option
ensures that both the RPC level authentication
scheme and the NFS level operations agree to use
numeric uids/gids if the mount is using the
'sec=sys' security flavour. In effect it is
disabling idmapping, which can make migration from
legacy NFSv2/v3 systems to NFSv4 easier.
Servers that do not support this mode of operation
will be autodetected by the client, and it will fall
back to using the idmapper.
To turn off this behaviour, set the value to '0'.
