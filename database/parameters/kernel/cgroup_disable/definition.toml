description = '''Disable a particular controller or optional feature
The effects of cgroup_disable=foo are:
- foo isn't auto-mounted if you mount all cgroups in
a single hierarchy
- foo isn't visible as an individually mountable
subsystem
- if foo is an optional feature then the feature is
disabled and corresponding cgroup files are not
created
{Currently only "memory" controller deal with this and
cut the overhead, others just disable the usage. So
only cgroup_disable=memory is actually worthy}
Specifying "pressure" disables per-cgroup pressure
stall information accounting feature
