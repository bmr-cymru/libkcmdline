description = '''Advanced Configuration and Power Interface
force -- enable ACPI if default was off
on -- enable ACPI but allow fallback to DT [arm64,riscv64]
off -- disable ACPI if default was on
noirq -- do not use ACPI for IRQ routing
strict -- Be less tolerant of platforms that are not
strictly ACPI specification compliant.
rsdt -- prefer RSDT over (default) XSDT
copy_dsdt -- copy DSDT to memory
nocmcff -- Disable firmware first mode for corrected
errors. This disables parsing the HEST CMC error
source to check if firmware has set the FF flag. This
may result in duplicate corrected error reports.
nospcr -- disable console in ACPI SPCR table as
default _serial_ console on ARM64
For ARM64, ONLY "acpi=off", "acpi=on", "acpi=force" or
"acpi=nospcr" are available
For RISCV64, ONLY "acpi=off", "acpi=on" or "acpi=force"
are available
