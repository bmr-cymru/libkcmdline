description = '''3215 console drop mode.
When set to true, drop data on the 3215 console when
the console buffer is full. In this case the
operator using a 3270 terminal emulator (for example
x3270) does not have to enter the clear key for the
console output to advance and the kernel to continue.
This leads to a much faster boot time when a 3270
terminal emulator is active. If no 3270 terminal
emulator is used, this parameter has no effect.
