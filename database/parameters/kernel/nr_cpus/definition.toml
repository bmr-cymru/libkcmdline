description = '''Maximum number of processors that an SMP kernel
could support.  nr_cpus=n : n >= 1 limits the kernel to
support 'n' processors. It could be larger than the
number of already plugged CPU during bootup, later in
runtime you can physically add extra cpu until it reaches
n. So during boot up some boot time memory for per-cpu
variables need be pre-allocated for later physical cpu
hot plugging.
