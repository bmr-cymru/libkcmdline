description = '''Select preemption mode if you have CONFIG_PREEMPT_DYNAMIC
none - Limited to cond_resched() calls
voluntary - Limited to cond_resched() and might_sleep() calls
full - Any section that isn't explicitly preempt disabled
can be preempted anytime.  Tasks will also yield
contended spinlocks (if the critical section isn't
explicitly preempt disabled beyond the lock itself).
lazy - Scheduler controlled. Similar to full but instead
of preempting the task immediately, the task gets
one HZ tick time to yield itself before the
preemption will be forced. One preemption is when the
task returns to user space.
