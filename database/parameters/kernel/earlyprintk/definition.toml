earlyprintk is useful when the kernel crashes before
the normal console is initialized. It is not enabled by
default because it has some cosmetic problems.

Use "nocfg" to skip UART configuration, assume
BIOS/firmware has configured UART correctly.

Append ",keep" to not disable it when the real console
takes over.

Only one of vga, serial, or usb debug port can
be used at a time.

Currently only ttyS0 and ttyS1 may be specified by
name.  Other I/O ports may be explicitly specified
on some architectures (x86 and arm at least) by
replacing ttySn with an I/O port address, like this:
earlyprintk=serial,0x1008,115200
You can find the port for a given device in
/proc/tty/driver/serial:
2: uart:ST16650V2 port:00001008 irq:18 ...

Interaction with the standard serial driver is not
very good.

The VGA output is eventually overwritten by
the real console.

The xen option can only be used in Xen domains.

The sclp output can only be used on s390.

The bios output can only be used on SuperH.

The optional "force" to "pciserial" enables use of a
PCI device even when its classcode is not of the
UART class.
