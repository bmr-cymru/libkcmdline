0 - Lazy mode.
Request that DMA unmap operations use deferred
invalidation of hardware TLBs, for increased
throughput at the cost of reduced device isolation.
Will fall back to strict mode if not supported by
the relevant IOMMU driver.
1 - Strict mode.
DMA unmap operations invalidate IOMMU hardware TLBs
synchronously.
unset - Use value of CONFIG_IOMMU_DEFAULT_DMA_{LAZY,STRICT}.
Note: on x86, strict mode specified via one of the
legacy driver-specific options takes precedence.
