description = '''disable features for corrected errors, e.g.
polling timer and CMCI.  All events reported as
corrected are not cleared by OS and remained in its
error banks.

Usually this disablement is not recommended, however
if there is an agent checking/clearing corrected
errors (e.g. BIOS or hardware monitoring
applications), conflicting with OS's error handling,
and you cannot deactivate the agent, then this option
will be a help.
