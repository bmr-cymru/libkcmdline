Valid num: 0 or 1
0 - turn hardlockup detector in nmi_watchdog off
1 - turn hardlockup detector in nmi_watchdog on
rNNN - configure the watchdog with raw perf event 0xNNN

When panic is specified, panic when an NMI watchdog
timeout occurs (or 'nopanic' to not panic on an NMI
watchdog, if CONFIG_BOOTPARAM_HARDLOCKUP_PANIC is set)
To disable both hard and soft lockup detectors,
please see 'nowatchdog'.
This is useful when you use a panic=... timeout and
need the box quickly up again.

These settings can be accessed at runtime via
the nmi_watchdog and hardlockup_panic sysctls.
