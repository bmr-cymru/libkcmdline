processor = "kernel"
description = '''for printing system info when panic happens.
User can chose combination of the following bits:
bit 0: print all tasks info
bit 1: print system memory info
bit 2: print timer info
bit 3: print locks info if CONFIG_LOCKDEP is on
bit 4: print ftrace buffer
bit 5: replay all messages on consoles at the end of panic
bit 6: print all CPUs backtrace (if available in the arch)
bit 7: print only tasks in uninterruptible (blocked) state
*Be aware* that this option may print a _lot_ of lines,
so there are risks of losing older messages in the log.
Use this option carefully, maybe worth to setup a
bigger log buffer with "log_buf_len" along with this.
