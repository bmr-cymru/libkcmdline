description = '''Set the clock used for tracing events
at boot up.
local - Use the per CPU time stamp counter
in sync between CPUs.
global - Event time stamps are synchronize across
but better for some race conditions.
infrastructure grabbing the clock more than
once per event.
uptime - Use jiffies as the time stamp.
perf - Use the same clock that perf uses.
mono - Use ktime_get_mono_fast_ns() for time stamps.
mono_raw - Use ktime_get_raw_fast_ns() for time
stamps.
boot - Use ktime_get_boot_fast_ns() for time stamps.
Architectures may add more clocks. See
Documentation/trace/ftrace.rst for more details.
