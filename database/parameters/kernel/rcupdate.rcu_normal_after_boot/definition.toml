description = '''Once boot has completed (that is, after
rcu_end_inkernel_boot() has been invoked), use
only normal grace-period primitives.  No effect
on CONFIG_TINY_RCU kernels.

But note that CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT=y kernels enables
this kernel boot parameter, forcibly setting
it to the value one, that is, converting any
post-boot attempt at an expedited RCU grace
period to instead use normal non-expedited
grace-period processing.
