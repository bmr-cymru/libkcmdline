description = '''Control mitigation for the Micro-architectural Data
Sampling (MDS) vulnerability.

Certain CPUs are vulnerable to an exploit against CPU
internal buffers which can forward information to a
disclosure gadget under certain conditions.

In vulnerable processors, the speculatively
forwarded data can be used in a cache side channel
attack, to access data to which the attacker does
not have direct access.

This parameter controls the MDS mitigation. The
options are:

full       - Enable MDS mitigation on vulnerable CPUs
full,nosmt - Enable MDS mitigation and disable
SMT on vulnerable CPUs
off        - Unconditionally disable MDS mitigation

On TAA-affected machines, mds=off can be prevented by
an active TAA mitigation as both vulnerabilities are
mitigated with the same mechanism so in order to disable
this mitigation, you need to specify tsx_async_abort=off
too.

Not specifying this option is equivalent to
mds=full.
