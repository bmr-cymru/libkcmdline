description = '''IORDY enable mask.  Set individual bits to allow IORDY
for the respective channel.  Bit 0 is for the first
legacy channel handled by this driver, bit 1 is for
the second channel, and so on.  The sequence will often
correspond to the primary legacy channel, the secondary
legacy channel, and so on, but the handling of a PCI
bus and the use of other driver options may interfere
with the sequence.  By default IORDY is allowed across
all channels.
