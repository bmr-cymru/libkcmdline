description = '''Controls the behavior of vsyscalls (i.e. calls to
fixed addresses of 0xffffffffff600x00 from legacy
code).  Most statically-linked binaries and older
versions of glibc use these calls.  Because these
targets for exploits that can control RIP.

emulate     Vsyscalls turn into traps and are emulated
reasonably safely.  The vsyscall page is
readable.

xonly       [default] Vsyscalls turn into traps and are
emulated reasonably safely.  The vsyscall
page is not readable.

none        Vsyscalls don't work at all.  This makes
them quite hard to use for exploits but
might break your system.
