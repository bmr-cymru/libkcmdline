description = '''Format:
<ACS flags>@<pci_dev>[; ...]
Specify one or more PCI devices (in the format
specified above) optionally prepended with flags
and separated by semicolons. The respective
capabilities will be enabled, disabled or
unchanged based on what is specified in
flags.

ACS Flags is defined as follows:
  bit-0 : ACS Source Validation
  bit-1 : ACS Translation Blocking
  bit-2 : ACS P2P Request Redirect
  bit-3 : ACS P2P Completion Redirect
  bit-4 : ACS Upstream Forwarding
  bit-5 : ACS P2P Egress Control
  bit-6 : ACS Direct Translated P2P
Each bit can be marked as:
  '0' – force disabled
  '1' – force enabled
  'x' – unchanged
For example,
  pci=config_acs=10x@pci:0:0
would configure all devices that support
ACS to enable P2P Request Redirect, disable
Translation Blocking, and leave Source
Validation unchanged from whatever power-up
or firmware set it to.

Note: this may remove isolation between devices
and may put more devices in an IOMMU group.'''
