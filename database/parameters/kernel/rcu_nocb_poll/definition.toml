description = '''Rather than requiring that offloaded CPUs
(specified by rcu_nocbs= above) explicitly
awaken the corresponding "rcuoN" kthreads,
make these kthreads poll for callbacks.
This improves the real-time response for the
offloaded CPUs by relieving them of the need to
wake up the corresponding kthread, but degrades
energy efficiency by requiring that the kthreads
periodically wake up to do the polling.
