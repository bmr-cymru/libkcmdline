The controller # is the number of the ehci usb debug
port as it is probed via PCI.  The poll interval is
optional and is the number seconds in between
each poll cycle to the debug port in case you need
the functionality for interrupting the kernel with
gdb or control-c on the dbgp connection.  When
not using this parameter you use sysrq-g to break into
the kernel debugger.
