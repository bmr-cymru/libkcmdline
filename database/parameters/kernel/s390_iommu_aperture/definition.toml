description = '''Specifies the size of the per device DMA address space
accessible through the DMA and IOMMU APIs as a decimal
factor of the size of main memory.
The default is 1 meaning that one can concurrently use
as many DMA addresses as physical memory is installed,
if supported by hardware, and thus map all of memory
once. With a value of 2 one can map all of memory twice
and so on. As a special case a factor of 0 imposes no
restrictions other than those given by hardware at the
cost of significant additional memory use for tables.
