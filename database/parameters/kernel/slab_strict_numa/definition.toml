description = '''Support memory policies on a per object level
in the slab allocator. The default is for memory
policies to be applied at the folio level when
a new folio is needed or a partial folio is
retrieved from the lists. Increases overhead
in the slab fastpaths but gains more accurate
NUMA kernel object placement which helps with slow
interconnects in NUMA systems.
