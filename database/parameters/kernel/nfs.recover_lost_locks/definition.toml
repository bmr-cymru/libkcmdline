description = '''[NFSv4] Attempt to recover locks that were lost due
to a lease timeout on the server. Please note that
doing this risks data corruption, since there are
no guarantees that the file will remain unchanged
after the locks are lost.
If you want to enable the kernel legacy behaviour of
attempting to recover these locks, then set this
parameter to '1'.
The default parameter value of '0' causes the kernel
not to attempt recovery of lost locks.
