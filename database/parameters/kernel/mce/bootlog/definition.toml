description = '''enable logging of machine checks left over from
booting. Disabled by default on AMD Fam10h and older
because some BIOS leave bogus ones.

If your BIOS doesn't do that it's a good idea to
enable though to make sure you log even machine check
events that result in a reboot. On Intel systems it is
enabled by default.
