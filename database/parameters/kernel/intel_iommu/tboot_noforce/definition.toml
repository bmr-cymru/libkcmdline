Do not force the Intel IOMMU enabled under tboot.
By default, tboot will force Intel IOMMU on, which
could harm performance of some high-throughput
devices like 40GBit network cards, even if identity
mapping is enabled.
Note that using this option lowers the security
provided by tboot because it makes the system
vulnerable to DMA attacks.
